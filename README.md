# HJK’s Theorem

## Abstract
HJK’s Theorem introduces a novel mathematical framework that unifies principles across logic, computation, and abstract algebra. It aims to provide a foundation for cross-domain problem solving, emphasizing simplicity, universality, and generalizability.

## Statement of the Theorem
*(Insert the precise statement of HJK’s Theorem here. Example format below — replace with your exact formulation)*

> **HJK’s Theorem:** For every system `S` defined under a consistent rule-set `R`, there exists a transformation `T` such that `S(T)` preserves consistency while enabling extension across higher domains.

## Proof Outline
1. Define the system constraints and base assumptions.  
2. Construct transformation `T` as a mapping between substructures.  
3. Demonstrate invariance of consistency under `T`.  
4. Generalize to recursive extensions.  
5. Conclude with universal applicability.
